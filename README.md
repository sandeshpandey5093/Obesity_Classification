# Implementing Machine Learning in Health Risk Assessment: A Dockerized Approach

## Introduction

Obesity is a medical condition marked by excess body fat, posing significant global health challenges.
Accurate classification is crucial for understanding associated health risks and developing tailored treatment plans.
An advanced predictive modeling tool in machine learning, ideal for handling complex data sets in healthcare is needed.
Random Forest can be used for predictive purposes in such kinds of classification.
Features like age, gender, height, weight and bmi used for the classification.

## Conclusion

Our project demonstrates the effectiveness of the Random Forest algorithm in accurately classifying obesity levels based on crucial parameters like age, gender, height, weight, and BMI.
Our findings underscore the potential of machine learning in enhancing healthcare analytics, particularly in predictive modeling for obesity-related risks. 
This approach not only aids in early intervention strategies but also opens avenues for personalized healthcare solutions. 
Future work could explore the integration of additional variables and the application of more complex models for refined predictions.
